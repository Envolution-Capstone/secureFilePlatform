# Material UI v4 does not support React 18 yet, so you need to do npm install --force

## Overview:

**App.js:**
It imports various components and features from other files, such as Header, Sidebar, MyDrive, and ShareWithMe. It also imports Firebase functionality from the firebase module, including authentication, real-time database storage, and storage for files. The App component uses state and effect hooks to manage the user's authentication state, and conditionally renders the application or a login prompt depending on whether the user is currently authenticated. If authenticated, the App component sets up React Router routes and renders the various components that make up the main application UI.

**MyDrive.js:**
It is a functional component that receives a user object as a prop. It uses Firebase for storing files and retrieves the files that belong to the user by querying a collection named "myfiles". It renders the files in a grid view and a list view with their icons, names, owners, last modified time, and file sizes. The file size is converted from bytes to a more readable format. The component also has some styled-components for its design, and some icons from Material UI are used in it.

**ShareWithMe.js:**
This is a React component called ShareWithMe, which provides a user interface for managing documents shared with a user or group. It imports several Firebase modules for authentication, database, and storage, and uses Material UI components for rendering. The component has several states for managing the list of users, groups, and various modals, and also includes functions for handling user interactions such as changing groups and adding documents.

**DocumentTable.js:**
This is a React component called DocumentTable that displays a table of files with their metadata (name, shared by, last modified, and file size) using data from a Firestore collection called "myfiles". The files are displayed as both a grid and a list. The component imports several modules from Firebase and Material-UI, and exports itself as the default component for use in other React components.

**DocumentUploadModel.js:**
This is a React component named DocumentUploadModel that creates a modal popup to select and upload a file. It uses Firebase for authentication, firestore database, and storage for uploading files. It uses styled-components and Material-UI components for styling. It contains state variables for uploading and file, and functions to handle file selection and uploading. It renders a form with input fields for selecting and submitting a file. When the file is uploaded, it adds its information to the firestore database and closes the modal popup.

**GroupModel.js:**
This is a React component called GroupModel which creates a dialog box for creating a group with a group name and a list of users to add to the group. It uses Material-UI components such as Box, Button, Dialog, FormControl, MenuItem, OutlinedInput, Select, and TextField. It also uses Firebase for handling the creation of the group in the database. The component takes in several props such as openCreateGroupModel, setOpenCreateGroupModel, listOfUsers, and user.

**Header.js:**
This code is for the Header component of a web application. 
The main functionalities of this code are displaying the application logo, a search bar, and a user menu with several actions. The user menu shows the user's photo and name, and allows the user to sign out or add another account.

**MuiStyle.js:**
This code exports a function called useStyles that uses the makeStyles hook from the Material-UI library to define CSS styles for two classes: menu and selectBox. The menu class defines styles for a dropdown menu, while the selectBox class defines styles for a select box component. The styles for the menu class include setting the background color, positioning, box shadow, and border radius. The styles for the selectBox class include setting a left margin of 6 pixels.


**Sidebar.js:**
This is a React component that defines a sidebar for a web application. The component imports several Material UI icons and other libraries, and uses styled-components to define its styles. The component uses a modal to allow the user to upload a file to the app's database using Firebase. When the user selects a file and clicks the submit button, the component uploads the file to Firebase storage and saves information about the file to the app's Firestore database. The component also includes several buttons and links for navigating the app.

**UpdateGroupModel.js:**
This is a React component that exports the UpdateGroupModel function. It renders a Material-UI dialog that allows the user to update the name of a group and add members to the group. The component receives the following props:

openUpdateGroupModel: a boolean indicating whether the dialog is open or closed.
setOpenUpdateGroupModel: a function that sets the openUpdateGroupModel prop.
listOfUsers: an array of objects representing the list of users.
user: an object representing the current user.
group: an object representing the group to be updated.

The component uses several Material-UI components, including Box, Button, Dialog, DialogTitle, DialogContent, FormControl, MenuItem, OutlinedInput, Select, and TextField. It also imports and uses firebase to add the updated group to the Firestore database.
